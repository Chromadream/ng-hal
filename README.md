> An HAL Navigator for Angular2


## Usage

```bash
$ npm install ng2-hal
```

Register with Angular's dependency injection:
```ts
import {
  Navigator,
  ConversionStrategy,
  ConversionStrategyJson
} from 'ng2-hal';

const MY_PROVIDERS: any[] = [
  new Provider(ConversionStrategy, { useClass: ConversionStrategyJson }),
  Navigator
];
```

Please note: you also need Angular's ``Http`` ready for DI. It is required by ``Navigator``.


Navigation example:
```ts
import { Navigator } from 'ng2-hal';

@Injectable()
export class Foo {

  constructor(private navigator: Navigator) {}

  demo() {
    this.navigator
      .get('/my/hal-document.json')
      .subscribe((doc: HalDocument) => console.log(doc));
  }
}
```


## Demo application

## API Design Considerations

``d.ts`` are the API docs.
Please refer to the generated type definitions.


## Reading List

 * HAL - Hypertext Application Language: [specification](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html)
 * JSON Hypertext Application Language: [draft-kelly-json-hal-08](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08)
 * URI Templates: [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570)


## Heads up!

**This is still very much work-in-progress.**

### TODOs

 - [ ] URI templating
 - [ ] ``npm test``: add unit testing
 - [ ] ``Navigator`` API: convenient shortcut for follow-on navigation
   * e.g., ``follow((hal: HalDocument) => Observable<HalDocument>)``
   * currently, ``mergeMap()`` achieves desired behaviour â€“ just an alias?
 - [ ] ``Link`` API: uri templating as instance methods on ``Link``
   * requires: ``Resource`` implementation to map ``Object`` (declares as ts interface ``Link``) to class instances
 - [ ] publish to npm
 - [ ] ``ConversionStrategy``:
   * in later version, it would be nice to chose between ``hal+json`` and ``hal+xml``
   * also: have a multiple strategies registered, then choose the right one dependent on ``Content-Type``
 - [x] ``ConversionStrategy`` API: ``(res: Response) => boolean`` and ``(res: Response) => Resource`` is good
 - [x] ``HalDocument`` API: a tuple of ``(Request, Response, Resource)``?
 - [x] ``npm test``: for now, only build and linting


## Version History

 * ``v0.1.0`` first version on public npm registry
